# Focus-Filter
Focus Filter is a custom filter list designed for AdGuard. Its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites  (primarily Chinese platforms), allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.
> Note: This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard browser extension.

## 🚀 How to Use
Copy the raw link of the rule file and add it to AdGuard.

1. Open AdGuard Settings.
2. Go to Filters -> Custom.
3. Click Add custom filter.
4. Paste the following URL:
    ```text
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malagebidi/Focus-Filter/refs/heads/main/filter.txt
    ```
