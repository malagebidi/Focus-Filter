# 🎯 Focus-Filter
**Focus Filter** is a custom filter list for **AdGuard**, its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites (**primarily Chinese platforms**), allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.

> [!NOTE]
> This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard browser extension.

## 💡 Motivation
Over the years, the internet has gradually evolved into an **Attention Economy**. It is not just about addictive recommendation feeds; cluttered interfaces and superfluous design elements also scatter our focus and overwhelm our vision.

Focus Filter originated as a personal collection of rules built from my daily use, and now I am open-sourcing it to invite community collaboration.

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Open AdGuard Settings
2. Go to Filters -> Custom
3. Click Add custom filter
4. Paste the following URL
    ```text
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malagebidi/Focus-Filter/refs/heads/main/filter.txt
    ```

> [!TIP]  
> Websites change frequently. If you notice broken features or missing content, try disabling this filter temporarily to check if that resolves the issue.

## 🛠️ Best With
While Focus Filter covers a wide range of websites, highly complex platforms often require specialized tools. Using dedicated extensions alongside our rules ensures the best possible experience.
