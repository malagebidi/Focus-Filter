# 🎯 Focus-Filter
**Focus Filter** is a custom filter list for **AdGuard**, its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites (**primarily Chinese platforms**), allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.

> [!NOTE]
> This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard browser extension.

## 💡 Motivation
In the era of the Attention Economy, algorithms are designed to keep us scrolling endlessly. We often visit a site with a specific purpose, only to get trapped in a loop of recommendations.

Focus Filter was born to reclaim control. We believe tools should serve users, not consume them. By stripping away the noise, this project restores the internet to a place you actively explore, rather than passively consume.

## ⚙️ How to Use
