# 🎯 Focus-Filter
**Focus Filter** is a custom filter list for **AdGuard**, its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites (**primarily Chinese platforms**), allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.

> [!NOTE]
> This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard browser extension.

## 💡 Motivation
Over the years, the internet has gradually evolved into an **Attention Economy**. It is not just about addictive recommendation feeds; cluttered interfaces and superfluous design elements also scatter our focus and overwhelm our vision.

Focus Filter originated as my personal collection of rules built over years of daily use, and now I am open-sourcing it to invite community collaboration.
