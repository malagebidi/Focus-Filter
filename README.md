# Focus-Filter

**Focus Filter** is a custom filter list designed for **AdGuard**. Its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites, allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.

> **Note:** This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard standalone app or browser extension.
