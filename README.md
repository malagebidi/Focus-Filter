# 🎯 Focus-Filter
**Focus Filter** is a custom filter list for **AdGuard**, its primary goal is to remove recommended feeds, distracting elements, and "doom-scrolling" traps from various websites (**primarily Chinese platforms**), allowing you to focus on the content you actually want to watch.

> [!NOTE]
> This filter utilizes advanced AdGuard scriptlets and extended CSS. It is best used with the AdGuard browser extension.

## 💡 Motivation
In the era of the Attention Economy, platforms use sophisticated algorithms to keep us scrolling endlessly. We often visit a site with a specific purpose—to learn, to work, or to find an answer—only to find ourselves trapped in a loop of recommended videos and clickbait feeds hours later.

Focus Filter was born out of a desire to reclaim control. We believe that tools should serve users, not consume them. By stripping away the noise, recommendations, and "doom-scrolling" traps, this project aims to restore the internet to its original purpose: a library of information that you actively explore, not a television that passively feeds you.
